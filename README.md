GitHub Url:  https://jyotikaranmittal.github.io/belly-button-challenge/

Create a new repository for this project called belly-button-challenge.
Clone the new repository to your computer.
Inside your local git repository, copy the files from in the StarterCode folder contained within the Module 14 Challenge zip file. i.e. index.html, samples.json, and the static folder.

Complete the following steps:

Use the D3 library to read in samples.json from the URL https://static.bc-edx.com/data/dl-1-2/m14/lms/starter/samples.json.

Create a horizontal bar chart with a dropdown menu to display the top 10 OTUs found in that individual.

Use sample_values as the values for the bar chart.

Use otu_ids as the labels for the bar chart.

Use otu_labels as the hovertext for the chart.

Use otu_ids for the x values.

Use sample_values for the y values.

Use sample_values for the marker size.

Use otu_ids for the marker colors.

Use otu_labels for the text values.

Display the sample's metadata, i.e., an individual's demographic information.

Loop through each key-value pair from the metadata JSON object and create a text string.

Append an html tag with that text to the #sample-metadata panel.

Deploy your app to a free static page hosting service, such as GitHub Pages. Submit the links to your deployment and your GitHub repo. Ensure that your repository has regular commits and a thorough README.md file

Note: If you haven't covered GitHub Pages yet in class (as this will be introduced in Class 15.3), don't worry! As long as the finalized code is in your GitHub repository, deploying it can be done in just a few clicks. Focus on completing your app and making regular commits for now. We'll walk through the easy deployment process together in class.
